# Illinois-Institute-of-Technology-Project: Mental Health Assessment Tool

## Project Description

Students from all ages are at a high risk of developing mental health issues due to stress and the current learning situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to virtual learning practices, parents report that depression has increased among young children by 43%. 20% of college students state that their mental health has worsened since the beginning of the pandemic. This mental health assessment tool is a basic prototype of a marketable application that provides a short questionnaire to assess whether a student may need support from a professional. The application was created using the Swift programming language and the Xcode IDE specifically for iOS devices. 

Some challenges faced during the creation of this project were:
- Using segues to control the display between the two view controllers.
- Displaying the questions.
- Displaying the corresponding results based on the answer choices selected. 

Future versions of this assessment tool application would include:
- An option to email and save the results.
- More detailed questions to identify a particular mental health disorder a student may be suffering from. 

## Installation
To run the Mental Health Assessment Tool, an Apple device with the ability to support the Xcode IDE is required. This will allow the user to use the simulator to run and test the application. Provided is a link to download Xcode 14:Â https://developer.apple.com/xcode/. Once Xcode is installed, the project file (downloaded from this repository) can be opened. Adjust the simulator settings as per the user's preference by selecting the type of iOS device (iPad, iPhone, etc.) and click the build button to run the application on the simulator.

## Using the Project
After running the application on the simulator, click the begin button to start the quiz. After answering a series of 'yes or no' questions, the results of the quiz will be displayed on the same screen. At the end of the quiz, the user has the option to exit or restart the quiz. To exit, swipe down from the top of the screen to close the pop-up window. To restart, simply press any one of the answer choice buttons.
